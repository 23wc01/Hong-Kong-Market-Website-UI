            <p class="goal">Even Columbia&#39;s major supermarkets only dedicated a measly aisle or two to Asian stables like rice, soy sauce, ramen noodles, etc. Thus, the goal was established: To better supply Asian immigrants in Columbia, Missouri with a wider selection of Asian products and produce.</p>

            <p class="beginnings">As an immigrant from Taiwan himself, Chu-Jen Chen understood that for foreign immigrants in the US, food represented a connection to life back in the homelands. To be able to cook a traditional cuisine would allow immigrants to create a slice of home right here in America.</p>
